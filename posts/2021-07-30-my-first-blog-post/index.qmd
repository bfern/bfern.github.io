I could probably do with adding something to this website, so let's start by talking a little bit about myself.

My name's Brad, I'm in my mid to late 20s and currently living in London. I think I've decided to write this because I'm not too sure what I'm doing with my life. As I expect many other people can relate to, the pandemic has given us more time to think and decide what we really want to get out of life. Maybe putting my thoughts down on paper will help.

In this blog I plan to write about a variety of topics, but in particular I want to write about things that interest me. And even better if I can combine two or more of such things! These things are:

**Maths**. From a young age, I have loved numbers. When I was 8 or 9 years old, I would get home from school and watch countdown, waiting patiently for each numbers game just before the advert break. This was in the pre sky+ days, so I was under strict time pressure to find an answer (although my Dad is a big fan of the invention, I once found him sitting in front of a paused numbers game with "-26 mins" displayed). Sadly my mental arithmetic is not what it used to be, however my hunger for mathematics has not disappeared.

**Sport**, especially cricket. I am a cricket fanatic, I've spent way too many hours of my waking hours (also a lot where I should have been sleeping too) watching cricket, and I have sent down countless leg spinners to my brother in the local field (including a few ball of the century contenders). I also enjoy football, and just love sport in general.

**Data Science**. I kinda just fell into this field - I saw a role advertised that was for maths and sport, and five years later I'm still working in the same sector. Little did I know back then that this was data science, what data science was, or that data science is the sexiest job of the 21st century (https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century). Data can improve our understanding of the world, which is pretty cool.

**Problem solving, logical thinking, etc.** I'm nerdy what can I say.

**Making society a better place**. We all know there's a lot wrong with it. And when you spend time thinking about it even more, you realise there's even more wrong with it. Some particular issues that I care about are tech addition, loneliness in an increasingly global world, and understanding what truly makes people happy.

If anybody does stumble across this and for some mysterious reason fancies getting in contact with me then my email is bfern1994@gmail.com.
