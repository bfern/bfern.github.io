After England quite emphatically lost the third test and therefore the series to Australia a few days ago, there has been a lot of discussion on what is to blame. One thing that has been brought up a lot and probably the most is the English county season. The introduction of the Hundred competition and pushing the county championship to the fringes of the season have been frequently mentioned.  In this post, I will layout how I would structure the season if I was the ECB.

Firstly, before coming up with a structure, I think it's important to think what purpose the county game serves. In my opinion, it is for the following reasons:
* Make future English cricketers
* Give current supporters what they want, which is being able to see their team playing high quality competitive cricket
* Engage new fans
* Be financially viable

With this in mind, I think the following structure works perfectly to serve these reasons:

**Competitions**
* *County Championship.* Two divisions,with division one having 10 teams and division two having 8. Two teams get promoted/relegated each season. 13 games are played in divison one, with each team playing each other once before the table splits and the top 5 all playing one more game against each other, and similarly with the bottom 5 (SPL football style). 14 games are played in division two with each team playing each other home and away.
* *One Day Trophy.* North and south groups with 9 teams in each, with 8 games being played, 4 at home and 4 away. A knock out stage follows to decide the winner. The group games are played on Sundays to help increase attendances during the first half of the summer.
* *T20 Blast.* The whole competition is played in a 3.5 week block, with 8 games and a north/south group split like before, followed by quarter finals and then a finals day. Home and away games are the inverse of what happened in the one day trophy. No international white ball matches for England are scheduled during this so that the best players are available.

**Schedule**

* *Mid April - Mid July:* 9 county championship games and the entire one day trophy competition.
* *Mid July - Mid Aug:* T20 Blast competiton.
* *Mid Aug - Late Sept:* Final 5 rounds of the county championship (in divison 1 each team will only play 4 games and not play for one of the rounds)

**Justifications**
* There is not enough time in the calendar to play four competitions, as proven with the neglect of the one day trophy in 2021. The T20 Blast and the Hundred are very similar, and therefore you only require one. The T20 Blast sells out at all stadiums, and you can allow even more people to watch games by having more teams. The supporters of all teams deserve to see T20 games, not just those who luckily live in cities where test matches are played. The aspects that engaged new fans with the Hundred were the marketing and the TV air time, which could be replicated regardless of the teams in the competition. If the ECB really feel the need for a new format then the Blast can be a hundred balls per team competition. The only downside of losing the Hundred is that the quality of the competition then thins due to more teams competing, so this will probably weaken the English white ball teams. But the quantity of overseas T20 competitions means that there are many opportunities to play high quality white ball cricket before the international stage.
* The county championship is not banished (as much) to the sides of the season, so there are better conditions which will hopefully help towards producing international quality test cricketers. The final five rounds of the county championship are played without any other competitions happening, in order to allow the players to play their best quality cricket. Due to the format, the cricket should also be competitive at this stage with most teams fighting for something. Happening after the Blast can also help engage some of the newly aquired cricket fans into following the end of the county championship season.
* The one day trophy is played on Sundays in order to get more fans in. This means that this isn't played in a block, however this is too difficult to achieve without downgrading the county championship or the one day trophy itself. The requirement to be played in a single block is not as great as the Blast because there is not the same quantity of overseas players. Furthermore, some players like a bit of variety, and having the one day trophy at the same time as the county championship can give themselves a chance to play more freely. Players still get a chance to play white ball cricket in a block with the Blast later in the summer.
