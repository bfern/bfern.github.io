# bfern.github.io

This is the repository for my personal website [bfern.github.io](bfern.github.io).

## Development

This was written using quarto.

To publish, be on the master branch and run the command `quarto publish gh-pages`, and answer with yes to publish. This will push a `gh-pages` branch to the repository, that renders the site. You do not need to interact with the `gh-pages` branch directly.
