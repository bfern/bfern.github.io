I am a data scientist who has worked in a variety of roles across the sports betting, voluntary and e-commerce sectors. My career has been spent in small analytics teams and for this reason my technical skill set is expansive encompassing data engineering, data analysis and statistical modelling. I also have strong soft skills to engage with stakeholders around their requirements, learn from their domain expertise and present back my findings.

This is a technical blog writing about all things data science (currently they're mostly about cricket though). I also blog any random thoughts that come to my head on [medium](https://bfern1994.medium.com).

If you'd like to know more then feel free to get in touch!
